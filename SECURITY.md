# Security Policy

## Supported status

The current default branch and currently maintained releases and deployments are supported. Older releases receive security updates only when operationally practical.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for suspected vulnerabilities, credential leaks, private data exposure, authentication bypasses, payment-flow issues, supply-chain issues, or deployment misconfiguration.

Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting form](https://github.com/LCV-Ideas-Software/.github/security/advisories/new) or report privately by email:

- lcv@lcv.dev

Please include:

- affected repository, component, route, package, workflow, or public surface;
- affected version, release tag, commit SHA, or deployment URL when known;
- impact and exploitability;
- reproduction steps or a safe proof of concept, if available;
- whether any credential, personal data, payment data, private editorial material, or operational secret may be involved.

## Scope

In scope: application code, Workers/Pages functions, package publication, GitHub Actions, dependency and supply-chain configuration, repository publication boundaries, security documentation, and documented public service configuration.

Out of scope: social engineering, physical attacks, denial-of-service testing without prior written authorization, spam, automated noisy scanning, and reports that rely only on outdated browser or dependency versions without a concrete vulnerable path in this repository.

## Coordinated disclosure

LCV Ideas & Software will triage reports privately, request clarification when needed, and coordinate remediation before public disclosure. Public disclosure should wait until a fix or mitigation is available, unless there is an immediate user-safety reason to do otherwise.

## Operational baseline

This repository follows the LCV Ideas & Software single-operator security baseline:

- GitHub secret scanning and push protection;
- Dependabot alerts and security updates;
- versioned CodeQL Advanced Setup workflows in public repositories containing code;
- external GitHub Actions pinned by full commit SHA;
- workflow-level `permissions: {}` with the least `GITHUB_TOKEN` grant required by each job;
- privileged external credentials isolated in protected environments and never exposed to pull-request jobs;
- pull requests, squash-only merges, resolved conversations, and required checks enforced by effective rulesets and GitHub's native merge queue;
- no long-lived secrets in source control.

## Automation policy

Dependabot checks every supported ecosystem daily, automatically rebases its pull requests, and relies on GitHub's post-merge branch deletion. Ordinary version updates use a seven-day cooldown for stability; Dependabot security updates are exempt from that delay. Required security and quality checks are never bypassed. Queue admission remains an authorized human action until a repository-scoped GitHub App with only the necessary permissions is separately approved and deployed.

Repository-local workflow and ruleset maintenance may implement this baseline. Enterprise or organization rules, settings, applications, and secrets require separate explicit operator consent before any change.
